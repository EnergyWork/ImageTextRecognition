--oem N
    Specify OCR Engine mode. The options for N are:
    0 = Original Tesseract only.
    1 = Neural nets LSTM only.
    2 = Tesseract + LSTM.
    3 = Default, based on what is available.

--psm N
    Set Tesseract to only run a subset of layout analysis and assume a certain form of image. The options for N are:
    0 = Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.
    1 = Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
    2 = Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR.
    3 = Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)
    4 = Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
    5 = Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
    6 = Assume a single uniform block of text.
    7 = Treat the image as a single text line.
    8 = Treat the image as a single word.
    9 = Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
    10 = Treat the image as a single character.
    11 = Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.
    12 = Sparse text with OSD.
    13 = Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line, bypassing hacks that are Tesseract-specific.  

Single options:
  -h, --help            Show minimal help message.
  --help-extra          Show extra help for advanced users.
  --help-psm            Show page segmentation modes.
  --help-oem            Show OCR Engine modes.
  -v, --version         Show version information.
  --list-langs          List available languages for tesseract engine.
  --print-parameters    Print tesseract parameters.

--tessdata-dir PATH
    Specify the location of tessdata path.

--user-patterns FILE
